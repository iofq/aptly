# Repository and Mirror Snapshots
<div>
Snapshot is a fixed state of remote repository mirror or local repository. Internally snapshot is list of references to packages. Snapshot is immutable, i.e. it canâ€™t be changed since it has been created. Snapshots could be merged, filtered, individual packages could be pulled, snapshot could be verified for missing dependencies. Finally, snapshots could be published as repositories.
